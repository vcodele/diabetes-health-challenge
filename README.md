# Diabetes Health Challenge (30-Day Data Project)

This is a 30-day data science challenge where I analyze health indicators to predict diabetes risk using machine learning.

### 🔍 Goal
Use real-world health data to:
- Clean and explore patterns in health behavior
- Build a predictive model for diabetes
- Communicate insights through visualizations and dashboards

### 📅 Timeline
- Day 1: Setup and data exploration
- Day 30: Publish final insights + blog post

Stay tuned!
